# Founders NFTs

These NFTs are designed to collect the funds necessary to build and promote the early stages of the [Origin project](https://github.com/jakubGodula/Origin).

## Disclaimer
**There are no guarantees at the moment other than being recognized as an early founder of the project.**

## Fundraising Goal
The project aims to raise at least **20,000 USDC**. This will be achieved by selling all NFTs from a single tier of NFTs. Selling all NFTs will raise **60,000 USDC** and allow the project to continue its development towards later phases of the project.

*   **Tier 1**: 1 NFT
*   **Tier 2**: 10 NFTs
*   **Tier 3**: 100 NFTs

## Collection Information

All NFTs, regardless of tier, are part of the same **FoundersNFT** collection. This ensures that they are listed together on marketplaces like TradePort under a single contract address. The `tier` attribute in the metadata distinguishes the different levels.
